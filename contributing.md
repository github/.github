# GitHub Security Policy

Software security researchers are increasingly engaging with Internet companies to hunt down vulnerabilities. Our bounty program gives a tip of the hat to these researchers and provides rewards of $30,000 or more for critical vulnerabilities.

If youâ€™ve found a vulnerability, [submit it here](https://hackerone.com/github).

You can find useful information in our [rules](https://bounty.github.com/#rules), [scope](https://bounty.github.com/#scope), [targets](https://bounty.github.com/#scope) and [FAQ](https://bounty.github.com/#faqs).
