# GitHub Security Policy

GitHub's [Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com) rewards researchers for discovering security vulnerabilities in a number of repositories. The full list of projects that are eligible for rewards are [available on our Bug Bounty site](https://bounty.github.com/#scope).

If the repository is eligible for rewards, you can submit a report via [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/github). You can find more useful information in our [rules](https://bounty.github.com/#rules) and [FAQ](https://bounty.github.com/#faqs).

For repositories not covered by the Bug Bounty program, please open an issue.
