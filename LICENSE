One thing that seems to be missing from the open source guide at the moment is any information about how to handle security disclosures. We (GitHub) just released a feature called the security policy, which uses a file called security.md to allow maintainers to tell users how to handle disclosure.

It's easy enough to document that, but I'd love to get more content in place about what should go into a security policy in general. There's a bunch of content out there on this including HackerOne's policy builder, the NTIA Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure template and Securitytxt.org.

Do we have consensus on what the necessary parts of the policy should be? I'd love to start by building that list, then we can build this out into an article.
