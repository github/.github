# GitHub Security Policy

Software security researchers are increasingly engaging with Internet 
companies to hunt down vulnerabilities. Our bounty program gives a tip of the 
hat to these researchers and provides rewards of $30,000 or more for critical 
vulnerabilities.

If youâ€™ve found a vulnerability, [submit it here][hackerone].

You can find useful information in our [rules][gh-rules],
[scope][gh-scope], [targets][gh-target] and [FAQ][gh-faq].
