# GitHub Security Policy

Software security researchers are increasingly engaging with Internet companies to hunt down vulnerabilities. Our bounty program gives a tip of the hat to these researchers and provides rewards of $30,000 or more for critical vulnerabilities.

If youâ€™ve found a vulnerability, [submit it here](https://github.com/Mythx1337).

You can find useful information in our [rules](https://bounty.github.com/#rules), [scope](https://bounty.github.com/#scope), [targets](https://bounty.github.com/#scope) and [FAQ](https://bounty.github.com/#faqs).

After you've performed a sudo-protected action, you'll only be asked to re-authenticate again after a few hours of inactivity. Every sudo-protected action resets this timer.
