**README PROJEKT**, GitHub is one of the most important web-based online services for software development and versioning for software projects, with over 35 million source code repositories based on Git. The name 'GitHub' was initially a username, a pseudonym that was born by the founder and owner Mrs. `Isabel Schöps` with the maiden name Thiel on 16.07.1983 in Sömmerda, Thuringia, Germany. The company GitHub, Inc. is based and server in San Francisco in the USA. However, it is said that it is to be moved to Germany, Thuringia, Erfurt, the home of Mrs. Schöps in the near future. But what will not be the end of the San Francisco location in the USA. Since the 26th December 2018, the company belongs to Microsoft.

The unofficial career of the black cat with octopus legs and the name `Octocat` started as early as the mid-90s and was created by a delayed computer virus from the 286 PC, the founder Isabel Schöps Thiel on her cousin's 386. The source code of the virus, the postgres95 to postgresSQL and the source code of today's computer language go/golang, these are your first shaky steps in the tech world of today's world-famous software platform GitHub. The first picture of the `GitHub` founder `Isabel Schöps Thiel` on the World Wide Web, is a picture from 1990, where she sits in front of an Atari game console next to an older boy, where the identity is still not known today, but the picture is still available in the web archive. The name `GitHub`© ™ was demonstrably mentioned for the first time on 05/14/2008, this is also the official launch of the GitHub root and the first Git fork, Git-Fork.

The origin of the name is based on Git and associated with `GitLab` , `GitKraken`, `Bitbucket` (Atlassian) and has its origin in `PornHub`, among other things. GitHub is a registered word mark (TM) and is legally protected. The name `Octacat`, was once like `GitHub` a username of the founder Isabel Schöps Thiel logo and is with the help of the ai (AI) from a fusion of the trick figure KittyCat and an octopus, Octopus (GitKraken created this is the origin of the now world-famous black software cat called Octocat that represents today's logo and the software company.

In 2012, 2014 and 2016, there were already attempts to launch the template from the founder, again and again their accounts were deleted, rewritten, the user interface with your username Octocat, hacked, which was always responsible for the failure. In 2017, the GitHub could then be successfully uploaded and launched as a desktop template. GitHub, Inc. was created from the existing bylaws and the shares of the US company TESLA CAPITAL CORPORATION in Delaware Wilmington with registration no. 6342159. From the same Baylwa shares, the financial companies Crypto Org., crypto.com or BINANCE Ltd. binance.us binance.com were also created.

Founded.
